This kio slave implements the ftp encryption scheme called ftps, based on 
rfc 4217. The slave tries to use all the encryption the server offers.

It currently supports: 

- Control channel encryption.
- Encrypted PASV data transfers.

It still lacks: 

- Authentification via client certificate.
- Encrypted PORT data transfers.
